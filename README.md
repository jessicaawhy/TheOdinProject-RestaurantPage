# Restaurant Page

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)

This is a restaurant website created using npm, webpack, and ES6 modules. The website is inspired by [this one](https://www.junisf.com/) and all images and texts are borrowed. I used the images from the website's home page and featured them in an image carousel.
